            % the tests realised over 86 C-PODS) DT = 114.5 dB re 1uPa
            % peak-peak. As we are considering 0-peak pressures to derive
            % TL with BELLHOP model we need to consider 0-peak detection
            % threshold. To do so we assume that clicks are symetric
            % signals which implies that 0-peak pressure Pp is equal to 1/2
            % * peak-peak presurre Ppp i.e Ppp = 2Pp. Therefore,
            % considering the log10 one can deduce the following relations
            % between 0-peak detection threshold and peak-peak detection
            % threshold: DTpp = DTp + 3 (dB)

            % peak-to-peak (pp) across the C-PODs used in the study."
            % This threshold is divided by to because SPL is derived from
            % BELLHOP output considering 0 to peak pressure.
